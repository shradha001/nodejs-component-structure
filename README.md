# NodeJs Boilerplate

This project structure aims at structuring the code based on components.

## Features

- **Component based** project structure
- [Celebrate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/celebrate) to **validate request parameters**

- Log using [Winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) and [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)

- **Swagger documentation** for the APIs.

- [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to automatically restart the application when file changes

- **ESLint** for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

- **Prettier** as the code formatter

- Test cases using **Mocha** and **Chai**

- **Coverage report** using [nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc)

- **Build** and **lint commit messages** using commitizen and commitlint

- **MongoDB database** integration

- **Git hooks** to check for lint before commit and test cases before a git push
